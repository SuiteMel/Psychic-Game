## Psychic Game

In this project the user tries to guess what letter has been randomly chosen by the game by selecting keys on the keyboard. You have 9 guesses to get it right, and if you get it you're psychic! You will also get a new letter. If you don't guess the correct the letter you lose and get a new letter.

### Why Make the Psychic Game

The psychic game was a test of my ability to use Javascript. I was able to impliment events, functions, arrays and dom manipulation to successfully meet the goals of creating this game.
